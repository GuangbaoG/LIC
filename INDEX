LIC                     The LIC criterion is to determine the most
                        informative subsets so that the subset can
                        retain most of the information contained in the
                        complete data.
OSA                     The OSA gives a simple average estimatoris by
                        averaging all these least squares estimators.
OSM                     The OSM is a median processing method for the
                        central processor.
Opt1                    The Opt1 chooses the optimal index subset based
                        on minimized interval length.
Opt2                    The Opt2 chooses the optimal index subset based
                        on maximized information sub-matrix.
